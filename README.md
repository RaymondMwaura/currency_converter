# Currency Converter

This App consumes the two APIs below to create a currency converter:

- [Currency Exchange](https://rapidapi.com/fyhao/api/currency-exchange)
- [REST Countries v1](https://rapidapi.com/apilayernet/api/rest-countries-v1)

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

Start the server by running

```BASH
npm start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` will cause pages to reload.
